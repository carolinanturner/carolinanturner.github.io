<!--Paragraph 1-->
<p>Welcome to the Gamecock Cafe! We serve cups of coffee to Gamecocks in need of a caffeine boost. Our coffee is locally and ethically sourced, 
    and brewing begins at 6:00 AM every morning, seven days a week. For our fall season, we're introudcing a new Cinnamon Maple Latte, a Toasted
    Marshmallow Cold Foam Cold Brew, and bringing back our Gamecocks all time favorite, the Pumpkin Spice Latte! 
</p>
    <!--Paragraph 2-->
<p>
    If you're feeling hungry, try our hot and savory breakfast sandwiches or one of our sweet homemade pastries! Our Horseshoe frosted cookies won't dissapoint,
    but if you'd rather try a hot bacon egg and cheese sandwhich instead, The Gamecock Cafe has your back! Our high speed Wi-Fi is free to all Gamecocks, and we 
    have three study rooms with white boards that can be reserved ahead of time for you and your study buddies! Whenever you're ready to
    stop by, you can find us behind the Swearingen Engineering building on Main Street in Columbia. We look forward to serving you!
